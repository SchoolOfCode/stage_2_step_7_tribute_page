          <h3 class="title">Mayor events in his life</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Born on 1 July 1818 in the Tabán neighbourhood of Buda (today part of Budapest, Hungary)</li>
            <li>Ignaz began studying law at the University of Vienna in the autumn of 1837, but by the following year, for reasons that are no longer known, he had switched to medicine.</li>
            <li>Semmelweis was appointed assistant to Professor Johann Klein in the First Obstetrical Clinic of the Vienna General Hospital on 1 July 1846.<br>Semmelweis was puzzled that puerperal fever was rare among women giving street births.</li>
            <li><h4 class="sub-title">Theory of cadaverous poisoning:</h4>Semmelweis' breakthrough occurred in 1847.He proposed that he and the medical students carried "cadaverous particles" on their hands from the autopsy room to the patients they examined in the First Obstetrical Clinic.< br>He instituted a policy of washing hands between autopsy work and the examination of patients.<br>The result was the mortality rate in the First Clinic declined 90%</li>
            <li>During 1848, Semmelweis widened the scope of his washing protocol, to include all instruments coming in contact with patients in labour, and used mortality rates time series to document his success in virtually eliminating puerperal fever from the hospital ward.</li>
            <li>Semmelweis was warning against all decaying organic matter, not just against a specific contagion that originated from victims of childbed fever themselves.<br>Some accounts emphasize that Semmelweis refused to communicate his method officially to the learned circles of Vienna, nor was he eager to explain it on paper.</li>
            <li>On 20 May 1851, Semmelweis took the relatively insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician position of the obstetric ward of Pest's small Szent Rókus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe agony, and four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851–1855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).</li>
            <li>In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: "Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories.</li>
            <li>In mid-1865, his public behaviour became exasperating and embarrassing to his associates. He also began to drink immoderately.</li>
            <li>In 1865, János Balassa wrote a document referring Semmelweis to a mental institution.<br>He was severely beaten by several guards, secured in a straitjacket, and confined to a darkened cell.<br>He died after two weeks, on 13 August 1865, aged 47, from a gangrenous wound, due to an infection on his right hand which might have been caused by the struggle.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p id="summary">He was revolutionary. He had an inventive mindset and as it happens way too often he was not listened to in the wide audience, but still could manage to spark others to do more work on his theory and thanks to that we don't even hear about those threat to women in labour or newborn babies what he had to encounter with. He wanted to change the world to a better place, unfortunatelly he couldn't see the results, but is definitelly here.</p>
