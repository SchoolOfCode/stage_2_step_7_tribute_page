          <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Mary Jackson's life:
            </h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1920's</strong> Born in Hampton, Virginia
              </li>
              <li><strong>1942</strong> Mary Jackson earned bachelor's degrees in mathematics and physical science from Hampton University in 1942.
              </li>
              <li><strong>1970's</strong> Jackson served for more than 30 years as a Girl Scout leader.[4] In the 1970s she helped African American children in her community create a miniature wind tunnel for testing airplanes.
              </li>
              <li><strong>1950's</strong> In 1951, Jackson was recruited by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
              </li>
              <li><strong>1970's</strong>
              By 1979, Jackson had achieved the most senior title within the engineering department. She decided to take a demotion in order to serve as an administrator in the Equal Opportunity Specialist field. After undergoing training at NASA Headquarters, she returned to Langley.
              </li>
              </ul>
              She worked to make changes and highlight women and other minorities who were accomplished in the field. She served as both the Federal Women's Program Manager in the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs and as the Affirmative Action Program Manager, and she worked to influence the career paths of women in science, engineering, and mathematics positions at NASA. She continued to work at NASA until her retirement in 1985.
